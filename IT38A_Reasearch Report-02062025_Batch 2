Comparative Analysis of Successful and Failed Enterprise System Implementations

Case Study 1: Successful Enterprise System Implementation
b.1. Company Overview
Company Name: Cisco Systems
Reason for Implementation
- Cisco needed an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system to support its rapid growth,
streamline operations, and replace its outdated legacy systems, which could no longer handle increasing transaction volumes.
b.2. Implementation Process
- Cisco partnered with Oracle to deploy a new ERP system in just nine months, following a well-structured and phased implementation approach.
The company invested heavily in training and change management, ensuring employee buy-in and seamless integration with existing processes.
b.3. Key Success Factors
• Strong Executive Support
- Cisco’s top management actively supported the project.
• Clear Business Objectives
- The ERP system aligned with Cisco’s need for scalable operations.
•Robust Change Management
-Comprehensive training and communication strategies were implemented.
•Effective Vendor Collaboration
-A close partnership with Oracle ensured timely delivery and issue resolution.
•Rapid Implementation
-A well-planned timeline minimized disruptions.
b.4. Outcomes & Impact
•Increased efficiency and scalability in business operations.
•Enhanced real-time data analytics for better decision-making.
•Reduction in system downtime and operational costs.
•Improved customer service due to streamlined processes.

Case Study 2: Failed Enterprise System Implementation
c.1. Company Overview
Company Name: Hershey’s
Reason for Implementation
- Hershey’s sought to upgrade its ERP system to streamline supply chain and customer service operations,
aiming for better efficiency and integration.
c.2. Implementation Process & Challenges
Hershey’s attempted a “big bang” approach, launching SAP’s ERP system along with CRM and supply chain management (SCM) software simultaneously.
However, the project faced major challenges, including an overly ambitious timeline, insufficient user training, and inadequate system testing before deployment.
c.3. Key Failure Factors
•Unrealistic Timeline
- The system was rushed to go live before the holiday season, leading to operational bottlenecks.
•Poor Change Management
- Employees were not adequately trained on the new system.
•Lack of Sufficient Testing
- Critical bugs were not identified before deployment.
•Overly Complex Implementation
- Too many systems were integrated at once, increasing risk.
c.4. Outcomes & Consequences
•Massive delays in order fulfillment, resulting in a $100 million revenue loss.
•Stock shortages and customer dissatisfaction.
•Brand reputation damage and loss of market trust.
•Need for extensive corrective actions, adding more costs.

Comparative Analysis
d.1. Similarities & Differences
•Both companies aimed to enhance operations through enterprise system implementation.
•Cisco followed a gradual, well-structured approach, whereas Hershey’s rushed the process.
•Cisco prioritized training and change management, while Hershey’s overlooked them.
d.2. Critical Success vs. Failure Factors
•Success
- Strong leadership, phased rollout, proper training, and testing.
•Failure
- Unrealistic timeline, inadequate testing, lack of training, and rushed implementation.
d.3. Key Takeaways & Lessons Learned
•What did the successful case do right?
- Cisco ensured executive involvement, a well-planned timeline, and thorough testing.
•What went wrong in the failed case?
- Hershey’s attempted a rushed implementation with insufficient testing and training.
•How can future implementations avoid similar failures?
- Companies should adopt a phased approach, prioritize user training, and conduct extensive testing before deployment.

Insights & Recommendations
e.1. Best Practices for Successful Enterprise System Implementation
